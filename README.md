#  Async Weather & News Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **asynchronous JavaScript** with both **Callbacks** and **Async/Await** to fetch real-time **weather** and **news** data from public APIs.  
It is part of a learning project for understanding **JavaScript concurrency**, **API requests**, and **Promise handling** in Node.js.

##  Learning Objectives
- Understand **Callback flow** and **Callback Hell**
- Use **Promises** and **Async/Await**
- Fetch and display data from multiple APIs
- Handle asynchronous code cleanly and efficiently

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTTPS module**
- **Open-Meteo API** (for weather data)
- **DummyJSON API** (for news data)
